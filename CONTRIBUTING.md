To test your software and problem solving skills, we ask you to implement some logic for a tictactoe game.

If you don't know the game, you can find more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

What is particular about this TicTacToe is that the dimension of the board can be different from 3X3, more than two players can play and the sequence of symbol needed to win can vary depending on the game.

The function we are asking you to implement takes as an input a game with it's current state and gives as an output the status of the game (won, tie, invalid, ongoing).

You can find some documentation about the format of the input and output of the game inside the interfaces folder.

To help you we also created a few tests that you can run to verify your solution.

If you feel that more tests could be needed to cover your code, don't hesitate to write them.

Once you have finished, send us a repo with your solution and tests.

Good luck!
